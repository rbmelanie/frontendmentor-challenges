## My process

### Built with

- HTML/CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Some CSS animation
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Small and simple component but was a good refresher for grid and flexbox nesting.
In fact I coded the container and top elements twice. First trying to use Flexbox on the main container and grid + flex within it. I finally settled on setting the main container as a grid instead.

The small animation on the button and the results allowed me to explore two properties I didn't used before which are transform and transition. Also it is not visible in the final product I learned how to apply two different transformation, the different types of transition etc.

### Continued development

- Using Javascript to laod the results from a json file.
